Welcome! I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/" target="_blank">Noémie Elhadad, PhD</a>. My primary research area involves leveraging machine learning and natural language processing to improve the quality and safety of patient care, support knowledge discovery in medicine, and promote health equity. I am especially passionate about using and expanding the vast toolbox that statistical and computational learning offers to better understand and improve the health of underserved communities. My PhD is funded by the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a> through a Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079-28).

Over the years, I have been very fortunate to have many [excellent mentors](/mentors). Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org){:target="_blank"} (BWH), <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen [research studies](/projects)  and would eventually develop my own projects with generous support from <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Catalyst</a>, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> (NCATS). Prior to this, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at Harvard, which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
