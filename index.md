Welcome! I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/" target="_blank">Noémie Elhadad</a>, and a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a>. Recently, I joined the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia" target="_blank">Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</a> Student Editorial Board and also serve as the Journal Club Manager. My primary research area leverages machine learning and natural language processing to improve the equity, quality, and safety of health care and support knowledge discovery in medicine. I am especially passionate about using and expanding the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate the study of health in underserved communities. My PhD is funded by the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a> through a Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079-28). I am also the recipient of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC).

Over the years, I have been very fortunate to have many [excellent mentors](/mentors). Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org){:target="_blank"} (BWH), <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen [research studies](/projects)  and would eventually develop my own projects with generous support from <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Catalyst</a>, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> (NCATS). Prior to this, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at Harvard, which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
