Welcome! I'm Harry (pronouns: he, him), a PhD student in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Noémie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/){:target="_blank"}, and a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I joined the [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association](https://academic.oup.com/jamia){:target="_blank"} Student Editorial Board and also serve as a Journal Club Manager.   

My research leverages machine learning and natural language processing to improve the equity, quality, and safety of health care and support knowledge discovery in medicine. I am especially passionate about using and expanding the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate the study of health in underserved communities. 

As a first generation college graduate, I have benefitted greatly from many [excellent mentors](/mentors) in my academic and personal journey. I am also an active member of the [Biomedical Science Careers Program](https://www.bscp.org/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard Medical School. Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org){:target="_blank"} (BWH), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} (HMS), and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen [research studies](/projects) and pursued my own projects with generous support from [Harvard Catalyst](https://catalyst.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to pursuing a career in biomedical informatics and health services research, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the [U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/){:target="_blank"} (PEPFAR) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.    

My PhD is funded by the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NLM)) and [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NIAID) through a Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079). I am also the recipient of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC).
