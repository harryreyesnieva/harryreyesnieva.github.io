<p>Welcome! I’m a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>. My primary research area involves leveraging artificial intelligence to promote health equity, improve the quality and safety of patient care, and support knowledge discovery in medicine. My work also concerns the fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics of intelligent systems in the health care setting. I’m funded by a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training Grant</a> (T15LM007079-28).</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org" target="_blank">Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a> (BWH), <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), and the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston</a> (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen <a href="/projects">research studies</a>  and would eventually develop my own projects with generous support from <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Catalyst</a>, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> (NCATS). Prior to this, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at HSPH, which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Over the years, I was very fortunate to have a number of <a href="/mentors">excellent mentors</a>.</p>
