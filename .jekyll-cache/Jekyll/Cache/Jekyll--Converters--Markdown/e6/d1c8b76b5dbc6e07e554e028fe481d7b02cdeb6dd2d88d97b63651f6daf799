Since 2017, I have been a predoctoral research fellow in the <a href="http://mterms.bwh.harvard.edu/our-team/" target="_blank">MTERMS Research Lab</a> led by Dr. Zhou. Dr. Zhouâ€™s primary research areas include natural language processing (NLP), temporal reasoning, knowledge representation, terminology standards, and clinical decision support.</p>

<p>Dr. Zhouâ€™s mentorship has had a tremendous impact on my professional and personal development. I approached her with the assumption that I would need to enumerate the skills and experience I might offer to help <em>her</em> reach the goals of her lab. As a refreshing reversal, in lieu of starting with what <em>I</em> might do for <em>her</em>, she started by noting that I had a number of unfunded projects of my own design. She inquired about the status of those projects (they had stalled given competing priorities while I worked for other PIs) and offered to help me focus on my own research and more long-term goals of pursuing a PhD and becoming a professor. <img style="float:right" src="/assets/img/mterms-lab.jpg" height="300" color="gray" vspace="10" hspace="10" />We conducted pilot research and applied for several grants (including the first application I ever wrote and submitted to the National Institutes of Health). This initial investment of time and support resulted in me receiving my first grant as an investigator; award-winning regional and national presentations; 4 manuscripts currently under review with major scientific journals; national media coverage of our research; clinically impactful work leading to system-wide changes at Partners Healthcare, one of the largest and leading health systems in the country; a specialized report in eCare, the Epic-based Partners electronic health record, to monitor population health for sexual and gender minorities; and a new curated data mart facilitating future studies on LGBTQ health.</p>

<p>Equally important, Dr. Zhou also helped me work on my own personal issues of confidence and prioritizing my own goals. She encouraged me to grow my network by collaborating with others, including those both more junior and senior to me, and connected me with colleagues across the world.</p>

<a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/phyllis-kanki/" target="_blank">Phyllis Kanki, DVM, DSc</a><br />
Mary Woodard Lasker Professor of Health Sciences, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
Principal Investigator, Harvard PEPFAR<br />

Dr. Kankiâ€™s research focuses on the virology, pathogenesis, and molecular epidemiology of HIV in Africa. Based on long term research collaborations in Senegal for over 24 years, <img style="float:right" src="/assets/img/kanki-lab.jpg" height="275" color="gray" hspace="20" />Dr. Kankiâ€™s work provided the initial characterization of HIV-2, demonstrated reduced virulence, transmission and progression to disease and interactions with HIV-1 subtypes from West Africa. In 2000, she created and directed the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN), with a $25 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.  This provided the collaborative foundation for the Harvard Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) providing prevention, care and HIV antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria, Botswana, and Tanzania (2004-2012). I was a member of the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/kanki-lab/lab-members/" target="_blank">Kanki Lab</a> for five years while working for the PEPFAR program.</p>
