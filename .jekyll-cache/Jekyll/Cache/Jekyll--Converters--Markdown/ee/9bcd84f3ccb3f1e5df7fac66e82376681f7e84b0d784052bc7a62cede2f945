<p>Welcome! I’m a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Biomedical Informatics</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>. My primary research area involves leveraging artificial intelligence to promote health equity, improve the quality and safety of patient care, and support knowledge discovery. Generally, my research interests concern developing and applying novel machine learning and natural language processing methods to study clinical cognition; assess disease risk, presence, progression and treatment response; identify disease subtypes and biomarkers associated with important outcomes; and study the fairness, accountability, and transparency of intelligent systems in the health care setting. I’m funded by a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training Grant</a> (T15LM007079-28).</p>

<p>Over the years, I have been very fortunate to have many <a href="/mentors">excellent mentors</a>. Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org" target="_blank">Brigham and Women’s Hospital</a> (BWH), <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), and the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston</a> (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen <a href="/projects">research studies</a>  and would eventually develop my own projects with generous support from <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Catalyst</a>, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> (NCATS). Prior to this, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at HSPH, which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
