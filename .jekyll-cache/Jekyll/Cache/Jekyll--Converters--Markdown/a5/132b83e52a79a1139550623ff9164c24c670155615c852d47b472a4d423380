Dr. Kanki’s research focuses on the virology, pathogenesis, and molecular epidemiology of HIV in Africa. Based on long term research collaborations in Senegal for over 24 years, Dr. Kanki’s work provided the initial characterization of HIV-2 and demonstrated reduced virulence, transmission, and progression to <img style="float:right" src="/assets/img/kanki-lab.jpg" height="275" color="gray" hspace="8" vspace="8" />disease and interactions with HIV-1 subtypes from West Africa. In 2000, she created and directed the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN), with a $25 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.  This provided the collaborative foundation for the Harvard President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) providing prevention, care and HIV antiretroviral therapy in Nigeria, Botswana, and Tanzania (2004-2012). I was a member of the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/kanki-lab/lab-members/" target="_blank">Kanki Lab</a> for five years while working for PEPFAR.
