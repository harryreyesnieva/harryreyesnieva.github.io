# Projects Submitted for Funding
**Financial Toxicity and Cancer Treatment: Examining Trends and Disparities via Causal Inference**  
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation HD4A Award  
Co-Principal Investigator (PI: Elhadad)  
The goal of this study is to apply state-of-the-art causal inference methods to isolate factors contributing to financial toxicity following cancer diagnosis in a large, longitudinal cohort. We will derive actionable insights that identify and quantify disparities in clinical and catastrophic financial outcomes, enabling policymakers and providers to prioritize targeted interventions most likely to reduce financial toxicity for the greatest proportion of the population while mitigating disparities in outcomes among different sociodemographic and socioeconomic groups.

# Clinical Innovations

**HDMH Monitor** / Principal developer   
HDMH Monitor is an online article repository and interactive dashboard that leverages natural language processing and machine learning methods to support scientific discovery via automated archive, search, information synthesis, and data visualization of articles concerning health disparities and minority health (HDMH) in MEDLINE.

**C-REACT: Contextualized Race and Ethnicity Annotations for Clinical Text** / Co-developer   
The C-REACT dataset is a large publicly-available corpus of sentences from clinical notes manually annotated for information related to race and ethnicity (RE). This corpus contains two sets of gold-standard annotations for RE data. The first set contains granular RE-information such as patient country of origin and spoken language. The second set of annotations contains RE labels manually assigned by clinicians. This corpus is intended to improve understanding about granular information related to RE contained within the clinical note and how this information might be used to infer RE.   

**CovidWatcher** / Co-developer   
An [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/covidwatcher/id1504295590){:target="_blank"} and [online portal](https://covidwatcher.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} that surveys users about their exposure to the new coronavirus (COVID-19), symptoms, access to medical care, and impact on daily life. The data collected is used to track the spread of coronavirus, giving citizens real-time information about hot spots and enabling health care officials to deploy resources where needed most.
