# Innovations

**Health Disparities and Minority Health (HDMH) Monitor** / Principal developer   
The [Health Disparities and Minority Health (HDMH) Monitor](https://hdmhmonitor.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} is an online article repository and interactive dashboard that leverages natural language processing and machine learning methods to support scientific discovery via automated archive, search, information synthesis, and data visualization of articles concerning HDMH in MEDLINE. It is based on a  [large-scale computational scoping review](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf9033){:target="_blank"} aimed at characterizing major topics found among nearly a quarter million scientific articles in the HDMH literature, examining change in topic mention over time, identifying notable gaps in coverage, and deriving actionable insights for further inquiry.

**C-REACT: Contextualized Race and Ethnicity Annotations for Clinical Text** / Co-developer   
The C-REACT dataset is a large publicly-available corpus of sentences from clinical notes manually annotated for information related to race and ethnicity (RE). This corpus contains two sets of gold-standard annotations for RE data. The first set contains granular RE-information such as patient country of origin and spoken language. The second set of annotations contains RE labels manually assigned by clinicians. This corpus is intended to improve understanding about granular information related to RE contained within the clinical note and how this information might be used to infer RE. 

**HERA: Health Equity Research Assessment** / Co-developer   
The [Health Equity Research Assessment (HERA)](https://data.ohdsi.org/HERACharacterization/){:target="_blank"} is a large-scale characterization conducted across [Observational Health Data Science Informatics (OHDSI)](https://www.ohdsi.org/){:target="_blank"} sites with heterogeneous populations and insurance coverage types, allowing for identification of persistent and generalizable trends in diagnosis differences. The HERA dashboard and visualizations can be used to download study data, further investigate health differences, and generate novel hypotheses.

Module reviews continuity of care, drug therapy initiation, loss to follow-up, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment, treatment failure, and treatment response.

**Harvard PEPFAR Nigeria Data quality assessment tool, version 2.0** / Co-developer   
Instituted major modifications to and evaluated a pre-existing EHR utility to incorporate expanded data quality indicators at 33 Harvard PEPFAR sites in Nigeria. With this utility, central and site-level data managers are able to better monitor and improve data completeness, validity, accuracy, and currency.
