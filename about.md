## Personal Statement 
  
I am a PhD student in the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI) at Columbia University, where I am advised by Prof. Noémie Elhadad, and hold an appointment at Harvard Medical School (HMS) as a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow in Medicine. My long-term goal is to become a professor of biomedical informatics. Building on two decades of domestic and international experience in public health practice and clinical research, my doctoral work examines and applies methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and spatial analysis to build equitable learning health systems, enable precision health, and contribute to knowledge discovery in medicine. In particular, my primary interests center around using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate the study of health in populations that are marginalized. My graduate training has been funded by fellowships from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Recently, I received a Computational and Data Science Fellowship from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group in High Performance Computing (SIGHPC), a highly competitive honor afforded each year to only eleven students in the world from disciplines spanning mathematics and astrophysics to chemical engineering and agriculture.   

My research goals are informed by a longstanding commitment to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. This is largely demonstrated by many years of service on JEDI-oriented research studies, committees, and working groups; capacity-building efforts devoted to resource limited settings and marginalized communities; and voluntary civil service. While at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, a $362 million grant to rapidly expand treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. In collaboration with clinical and other technical experts, I co-developed population-level dashboards and data-driven point-of-care tools to monitor and evaluate patient health in Nigerian clinics and hospitals. I also supported data-related training activities in Botswana, Nigeria, and Tanzania. During my three-year term appointment as a Commissioner of Human Rights for the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts (MA), I engaged the MA state legislature on important policies such as pay equity, protections relative to domestic violence, and anti-discrimination legislation for sexual and gender minority populations (e.g., people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \[LGBTQ]). I also presided over hearings and facilitated conciliations regarding complaints of discrimination against protected classes.

While co-chair of the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) LGBTQ and Allies Employee Resource Group, I lobbied Mass General Brigham (MGB), one of the largest and leading academic health systems in the country (formerly known as Partners Healthcare), to include SOGI among the core set of demographics routinely collected in the electronic health record (EHR). Subsequently, I was invited by MGB to serve on the working group that oversaw design and implementation plans impacting care for millions of patients. These efforts resulted in MGB becoming one of the first health systems in the US to collect SOGI in the EHR in a standardized, scalable fashion. For my contributions, I received the inaugural LGBTQ Leadership Award from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a Partners in Excellence Award for Leadership and Innovation from MGB, was featured in Boston Magazine and Harvard Medicine Magazine, and awarded several honors for related research.

During my time at HMS, HSPH, and BWH, I performed a variety of roles for more than a dozen research studies on quality, safety, and equity in healthcare including co-investigator, project manager, and statistical programmer. I also led my own grant-funded research to elucidate potential health and healthcare inequities along various intersecting dimensions such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). My research at Columbia expands on this line of inquiry by using advanced data science and informatics-driven approaches to generate new knowledge and develop robust scalable methods. I am also a founding member of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Working Group at Columbia DBMI and founding co-organizer of the Columbia University seminar series, Toward Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Informatics, Health Care, and Society. This builds on my past collaboration with Prof. Noémie Elhadad and Prof. Sandra Soo-jin Lee for the course, Interrogating Ethics and Justice in Digital Health, which they co-taught in Fall 2022 and for which I served as the teaching assistant and supported curriculum and course material development.

## Scientific Contributions

### Ethics in Digital Health, Artificial Intelligence, and Clinical Practice   
This work focuses on ethical considerations, perceptions, responsibilities, and implications in the digital age of healthcare. These studies primarily examine stakeholders and their relationships to one another, notions of data and algorithmic justice, and transparency and trust in clinicians and in artificial intelligence. Among these studies, we found that the medical profession is divided on appropriate boundary setting in relationships with patients, though a majority found many caring practices acceptable. Based on collaboration with a high-level consortium that included the Massachusetts Medical Society, Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and Health Care For All (HCFA), this work has also led to the creation of a consensus document regarding disclosure of medical errors and, when appropriate, taking responsibility and apologizing for any resulting harm.

### Documentation of Social Determinants of Health and Elucidating Healthcare Inequities   
This work leverages real-world data sources (e.g., electronic health records and biobanks) and advanced data science methods (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing) to improve documentation of the social determinants of health and examine health and healthcare inequities across intersectional dimensions of individual and group identity. It also includes studies spotlighting the myriad factors that influence the health needs of people from diverse backgrounds and the many ways in which this knowledge may be applied to deliver culturally competent care. Most recently, this work led to policy changes at a major academic health system, including a new mandate that clinicians can no longer “fire” patients for missing or failing to cancel clinical appointments, a practice that disproportionately harmed persons from historically marginalized groups. Prior to the change, “no-shows” were cited as the cause for termination in more than a third of cases. Notably, the majority of terminations were formalized via EHR functionality that made it both possible and relatively easy to prevent patients from scheduling new appointments with a specific provider, clinic, or the health system entirely, exacerbating barriers to healthcare access.

### Leveraging Multimodal Data, Data Science, and Informatics to Enable Learning Health Systems    
I have worked both domestically and internationally to support capacity building efforts and strengthen learning health systems. Working closely with quality improvement, monitoring and evaluation, and clinical specialists, I co-developed data-driven point-of-care tools and population-level dashboards that extract information from regional and national data warehouses and generate measures based on adult and pediatric quality of care indicators. These modules have reviewed continuity of care, drug therapy initiation, medication adherence, loss to follow-up, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment or diagnostic evaluation, treatment failure, toxicity management, nutritional assessment, and treatment response. This work also includes clinician and patient-facing smart medical devices such as an electronic pillbox that alarms to remind patients to take their medication; automated sensor-based detection of pill removal; alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if medications were not taken; and EHR-embedded adherence reports accessible by providers.

### Improving Quality and Safety in Healthcare   
This work focuses on improving the quality and safety of patient care by using mixed methods and real-world data sources (e.g., EHRs and closed malpractice claims) to study patterns of clinical behavior and bundling effective quality improvement techniques that target high-risk areas in clinics and hospitals. This work elucidated common pitfalls made by clinicians when diagnosing patients (information that can then be used to develop early warning screens in the EHR) and inappropriate prescribing behavior among providers linked to underestimates of themselves and overestimates of their peers. The latter study also found that primary care clinicians’ likelihood of prescribing antibiotics increased during clinic sessions, consistent with the hypothesis that decision fatigue progressively impairs clinicians’ ability to resist inappropriate ordering.
