My primary research area involves leveraging artificial intelligence to promote health equity, improve the quality and safety of patient care, and support knowledge discovery. Generally, my research interests concern developing and applying novel machine learning and natural language processing methods to assess disease risk, presence, progression and treatment response; identifying disease subtypes and biomarkers associated with important outcomes; and studying the fairness, accountability, and transparency of intelligent systems in the health care setting. I'm funded by a <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Training Grant</a> (T15LM007079-28).  

Prior to pursuing a career in health services research, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. As Data Quality Assurance Manager for the Nigeria country program, my focus was scale-up and transition of data quality improvement and assurance activities nationwide. In this capacity, I worked closely with in-country quality improvement, monitoring and evaluation, and clinical specialists while developing or modifying pediatric and adult quality improvement dashboards and monitoring and evaluation tools. My division reported to the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration</a> (HRSA), <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), and <a href="http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2010/nigeria_2010_country_progress_report_en.pdf" target="_blank">United Nations General Assembly Special Session</a> (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS.

# Clinical Innovations

**Pediatric quality improvement tool at 33 Harvard PEPFAR sites in Nigeria**  
Co-developed and evaluated a utility to extract information from electronic health record (EHR) data warehouse and generate measures based on 23 pediatric quality of care indicators. Programmed module to review continuity of care, drug therapy initiation, medication adherence, loss to followup, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment or diagnostic evaluation, treatment failure, toxicity management, nutritional assessment, and treatment response.

**Adult quality improvement tool at 33 Harvard PEPFAR sites in Nigeria**  
Co-developed and evaluated a utility to extract information from EHR data warehouse and generate measures based on 15 adult quality of care indicators. Module reviews continuity of care, drug therapy initiation, loss to follow-up, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment, treatment failure, and treatment response.

**Data quality assessment tool, version 2.0 at 33 Harvard PEPFAR sites in Nigeria**  
Instituted major modifications to and evaluated a pre-existing EHR utility to incorporate expanded data quality indicators. With this utility, central and site-level data managers are able to better monitor and improve data completeness, validity, accuracy, and currency.
