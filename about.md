I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Noémie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/){:target="_blank"}. For most of my PhD training, I was also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I served a 2-year term on the [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association](https://academic.oup.com/jamia){:target="_blank"} Student Editorial Board. 

Building on two decades of domestic and international experience in public health and clinical research, my doctoral work examines and applies methods such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and spatial analysis to build equitable learning health systems, enable precision health, and contribute to knowledge discovery in medicine. My research centers on using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate the study of health in populations and communities that are marginalized.

My PhD is funded by training fellowships from the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NLM) and [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"} (NIAID) through a Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079). I am also the recipient of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC), a highly competitive honor afforded each year to fewer than a dozen students in the world from disciplines spanning mathematics and astrophysics to chemical engineering and agriculture. 

I hold a Master of Philosophy and Master of Arts in Biomedical Informatics from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Master of Applied Science in Spatial Analysis from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"}, and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and History from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

## Scientific Contributions

### Elucidating Healthcare Inequities and Improving Documentation of Social Determinants of Health   
This work leverages real-world data sources (e.g., electronic health records \[EHR] and biobanks) and advanced data science methods (e.g., machine learning, natural language processing) to improve documentation of the social determinants of health and examine health and healthcare inequities across intersectional dimensions of individual and group identity. It also includes studies spotlighting the myriad factors that influence the health needs of people from diverse backgrounds and the many ways in which this knowledge may be applied to deliver culturally competent care. Most recently, this work led to policy changes at a major academic health system, including a new mandate that clinicians can no longer “fire” patients for missing or failing to cancel clinical appointments, a practice that disproportionately harmed persons from historically marginalized groups. Prior to the change, “no-shows” were cited as the cause for termination in more than one-third of cases. Notably, the majority of terminations were formalized via EHR functionality that made it both possible and relatively easy to prevent patients from scheduling new appointments with a specific provider, clinic, or the health system entirely, exacerbating barriers to healthcare access.

### Ethics in Digital Health, Artificial Intelligence, and Clinical Practice   
This work focuses on ethical considerations, perceptions, responsibilities, and implications in the digital age of healthcare. These studies primarily examine stakeholders and their relationships to one another, notions of data and algorithmic justice, and transparency and trust in clinicians and in artificial intelligence. Among these studies, we found that the medical profession is divided on appropriate boundary setting in relationships with patients, though a majority found many caring practices acceptable. Based on collaboration with a high-level consortium that included the Massachusetts Medical Society, Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and Health Care For All (HCFA), this work has also led to the creation of a consensus document regarding disclosure of medical errors and, when appropriate, taking responsibility and apologizing for any resulting harm.

### Leveraging Multimodal Data, Data Science, and Informatics to Enable Equitable Learning Health Systems    
I have worked both domestically and internationally to support capacity building efforts and strengthen learning health systems. Working closely with quality improvement, monitoring and evaluation, and clinical specialists, I co-developed data-driven point-of-care tools and population-level dashboards that extract information from regional and national data warehouses and generate measures based on adult and pediatric quality of care indicators. These modules have reviewed continuity of care, drug therapy initiation, medication adherence, loss to follow-up, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment or diagnostic evaluation, treatment failure, toxicity management, nutritional assessment, and treatment response. This work also includes clinician and patient-facing smart medical devices such as an electronic pillbox that alarms to remind patients to take their medication; automated sensor-based detection of pill removal; alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if medications were not taken; and EHR-embedded adherence reports accessible by providers.

### Improving Quality and Safety in Healthcare   
This work focuses on improving the quality and safety of patient care by using mixed methods and real-world data sources (e.g., EHRs and closed malpractice claims) to study patterns of clinical behavior and bundling effective quality improvement techniques that target high-risk areas in clinics and hospitals. This work elucidated common pitfalls made by clinicians when diagnosing patients (information that can then be used to develop early warning screens in the EHR) and inappropriate prescribing behavior among providers linked to underestimates of themselves and overestimates of their peers. The latter study also found that primary care clinicians’ likelihood of prescribing antibiotics increased during clinic sessions, consistent with the hypothesis that decision fatigue progressively impairs clinicians’ ability to resist inappropriate ordering.
