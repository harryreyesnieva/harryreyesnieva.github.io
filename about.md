My primary research area leverages machine learning and natural language processing to improve the equity, quality, and safety of health care and support knowledge discovery in medicine. Generally, my research interests concern assessing disease risk, presence, progression, and treatment; identifying disease subtypes and biomarkers associated with important outcomes; and studying the fairness, accountability, and transparency of intelligent systems in the health care setting. I am especially passionate about using and expanding the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate the study of health in underserved communities. My PhD is funded by the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">National Library of Medicine</a> through a Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079-28). I am also the recipient of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC).

Over the years, I have been very fortunate to have many [excellent mentors](/mentors). Before starting my PhD program, I held a number of positions at [Brigham and Women's Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org){:target="_blank"} (BWH), <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS), and the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} (HSPH). While at BWH and HMS, I served on more than a dozen [research studies](/projects)  and would eventually develop my own projects with generous support from <a href="https://catalyst.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Catalyst</a>, the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, funded by the <a href="https://ncats.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</a> (NCATS). 

Prior to pursuing a career in medical informatics and health services research, I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment and care programs for people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. As Data Quality Assurance Manager for the Nigeria country program, my focus was scale-up and transition of data quality improvement and assurance activities nationwide. In this capacity, I worked closely with in-country quality improvement, monitoring and evaluation, and clinical specialists while developing or modifying pediatric and adult quality improvement dashboards and monitoring and evaluation tools. My division reported to the <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration</a> (HRSA), <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), and <a href="https://data.unaids.org/pub/report/2010/nigeria_2010_country_progress_report_en.pdf" target="_blank">United Nations General Assembly Special Session</a> (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS.
