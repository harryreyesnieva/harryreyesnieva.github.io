    <h3>Harry Reyes Nieva, PhD, MAS </h3>

    Welcome! I am a postdoctoral research scientist with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine and public health. 
    I recently completed my PhD in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by 
    [No√©mie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/){:target="_blank"}.
    For most of my PhD, I was also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at 
    [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I served a 2-year term on the 
    [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association](https://academic.oup.com/jamia){:target="_blank"} Student Editorial Board 
    and was a co-organizer of the 2023 [Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium](https://ml4health.github.io/2023/){:target="_blank"}. 
    I am also a [DAAD AInet Fellow for Safety and Security in AI](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/){:target="_blank"} through the German
    Academic Exchange Service, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD).

    Building on a decade and a half decade of domestic and international experience in clinical and public health informatics, 
    my research focuses especially on human-centered AI and the development of systematic, scalable, data-driven approaches to 
    improve human health and well-being. My work usually examines and applies methods such as machine learning, natural language processing, 
    and spatio-temporal analysis in addition to traditional biostatistics and epidemiology. I am particularly interested in 
    using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, 
    improve, and facilitate study of health in populations and communities. Generally, my research can be grouped into four primary domains:

    1. Enabling learning health systems, precision medicine, and precision public health
    2. Improving health data capture and curation of new knowledge bases
    3. Elucidating heterogeneity in health outcomes and developing tools to facilitate discovery
    4. Ethical considerations in AI, clinical practice, and digital health

    My PhD was funded by training fellowships from the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/){:target="blank"} and 
    [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"}. I am also the recipient 
    of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} 
    from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance 
    Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC). In addition to my degrees in biomedical informatics, I also have a Master of Applied Science in Spatial Analysis from the 
    [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} and a Bachelor of Arts in 
    Sociology and History from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
