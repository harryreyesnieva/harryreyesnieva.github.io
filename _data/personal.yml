    Welcome! I'm Harry (pronouns: he, him). 
    I'm a PhD candidate in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I am advised by 
    [No√©mie Elhadad](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/profil/noemie-elhadad/){:target="_blank"}.
    For most of my PhD, I was also a Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow at 
    [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Recently, I served a 2-year term on the 
    [Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association](https://academic.oup.com/jamia){:target="_blank"} Student Editorial Board 
    and was a co-organizer of the 2023 [Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium](https://ml4health.github.io/2023/){:target="_blank"}. 
    I am also a [DAAD AInet Fellow for Safety and Security in AI](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/){:target="_blank"} through the German
    Academic Exchange Service, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD).

    My long-term goal is to advance health equity science. Building on two decades of domestic and international 
    experience in clinical and public health informatics, my research focuses especially on human-centered 
    artificial intelligence (AI) and development of systematic, scalable, data-driven approaches to promote 
    health equity. My work usually examines and applies methods such as machine learning, natural language processing, 
    and spatiotemporal analysis in addition to traditional biostatistics and epidemiology. I am particularly 
    interested in using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational 
    learning offers to better understand, improve, and facilitate study of health in populations and communities 
    that are marginalized. Generally, my research can be grouped into four primary domains:

    1. Ethical and justice considerations in AI, clinical practice, and digital health
    2. Promoting health data equity and creating new knowledge bases
    3. Elucidating health inequity and developing tools to facilitate further discovery
    4. Enabling equitable learning health systems and precision public health

    My PhD was funded by training fellowships from the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/){:target="blank"} and 
    [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"} through a Biomedical 
    Informatics and Data Science Research training grant (T15LM007079). I am also the recipient of a [Computational and Data Science 
    Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} from the 
    [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance 
    Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC). I have a Master of Philosophy in Biomedical Informatics 
    from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Master of Applied Science in Spatial Analysis from the 
    [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"}, 
    and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and History from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
