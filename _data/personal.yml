    <h3>Harry Reyes Nieva, PhD, MAS </h3>

    Welcome! I am a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Division of Infectious Diseases](https://www.infectiousdiseases.cuimc.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    at [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine and public health. I am also a [DAAD AInet Fellow for Safety and Security in AI](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/){:target="_blank"} through the German
    Academic Exchange Service, Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD). 
    I completed my PhD in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} 
    at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/){:target="_blank"} while concurrently a
    Visiting Postgraduate Research Fellow in the Department of Medicine at 
    [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 
    Prior to training in AI in healthcare, 
    I was a member of the Strategic Information division of the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank">U.S. Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
    Relief</a> (PEPFAR) at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard University</a> which aimed to rapidly expand antiretroviral therapy for people 
    living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.

    Building on a decade and a half of domestic and international experience in clinical and public health informatics, 
    my research focuses especially on human-centered AI and the development of systematic, scalable, data-driven approaches to 
    improve human health and well-being for everyone. My work usually examines and applies methods such as machine learning, natural language processing, 
    and spatio-temporal analysis in addition to traditional biostatistics and epidemiology. I am particularly interested in 
    using and interrogating multimodal data sources and the vast toolbox that computational learning offers to better understand, 
    improve, and facilitate study of health in populations and communities. Generally, my research can be grouped into four primary domains:

    1. Enabling learning health systems and precision health
    2. Improving health data capture and curation of new knowledge bases
    3. Elucidating heterogeneity in health outcomes and developing tools to facilitate discovery
    4. Ethical considerations in AI, clinical practice, and digital health

    My PhD was funded by training fellowships from the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/){:target="blank"} and 
    [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/){:target="_blank"}. I am also the recipient 
    of a [Computational and Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2021-fellowship-winners){:target="_blank"} 
    from the [Association for Computing Machinery](https://www.acm.org/){:target="_blank"} (ACM) [Special Interest Group in High Performance 
    Computing](https://www.sighpc.org/home){:target="_blank"} (SIGHPC). In addition to my degrees in biomedical informatics, I also have a Master of Applied Science in Spatial Analysis from the 
    [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu){:target="_blank"} and a Bachelor of Arts in 
    Sociology and History from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
