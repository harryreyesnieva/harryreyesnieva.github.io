  name: 'Leveraging Computational Methods to Advance Health Equity Science Through Evidence Synthesis, Strategic Monitoring, 
  and Precision Public Health'
  description: >
    The studies presented in this dissertation seek to advance health equity science by drawing from subfields of artificial 
    intelligence such as machine learning, natural language processing, and symbolic reasoning. This thesis employs 
    robust methods for big data collection, integration, and analysis to leverage existing and emerging data sources including 
    a large corpus of biomedical literature, electronic health records from the largest public health information exchange 
    in the United States, open government datasets, proprietary national insurance claims datasets, and public health reporting
    data.

  name: "Health Disparities and Minority Health (HDMH) Monitor / Principal developer"
  description: >
    The Health Disparities and Minority Health (HDMH) Monitor is an online article repository and interactive dashboard 
    that leverages natural language processing and machine learning methods to support scientific discovery via 
    automated archive, search, information synthesis, and data visualization of articles concerning HDMH in MEDLINE. 
    It is based on a [large-scale computational scoping review](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf9033){:target="_blank"} 
    aimed at characterizing major topics found among nearly a quarter million scientific articles in the HDMH literature, 
    examining change in topic mention over time, identifying notable gaps in coverage, and deriving actionable insights for 
    further inquiry.

  name: 'C-REACT: Contextualized Race and Ethnicity Annotations for Clinical Text / Co-developer'
  description: >
    The C-REACT dataset is a large publicly-available corpus of sentences from clinical notes manually annotated for 
    information related to race and ethnicity (RE). This corpus contains two sets of gold-standard annotations for RE data. 
    The first set contains granular RE-information such as patient country of origin and spoken language. The second set of 
    annotations contains RE labels manually assigned by clinicians. This corpus is intended to improve understanding about 
    granular information related to RE contained within the clinical note and how this information might be used to infer RE.

  name: 'HERA: Health Equity Research Assessment / Co-developer'
  description: >
    The Health Equity Research Assessment (HERA) is a large-scale characterization conducted across 
    [Observational Health Data Science Informatics (OHDSI)](https://www.ohdsi.org/){:target="_blank"} sites with heterogeneous 
    populations and insurance coverage types, allowing for identification of persistent and generalizable trends in diagnosis 
    differences. The HERA dashboard and visualizations can be used to download study data, further investigate health 
    differences, and generate novel hypotheses.

  name: 'CovidWatcher / Co-developer'
  description: >
    Covidwatcher is an app and online portal that surveyed users about their exposure to COVID-19, symptoms, access to 
    medical care, and impact on daily life. The data collected was used to track the spread of coronavirus, giving 
    citizens real-time information about hot spots, and enabling health care officials to deploy resources where needed most.

  name: 'Harvard PEPFAR Nigeria Adult quality improvement tool / Co-developer'
  description: >
    Co-developed and evaluated a utility to extract information from EHR data warehouse and generate measures based on 
    15 adult quality of care indicators at 33 Harvard PEPFAR sites in Nigeria. Module reviews continuity of care, drug 
    therapy initiation, loss to follow-up, laboratory monitoring, disease screening based on clinical symptoms assessment, 
    treatment failure, and treatment response.
